  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 7, 2025</p>

  <p>The Fizyo Takip application has been developed and released free of charge by Mehmet Akif Kara. This Privacy Policy explains how Fizyo Takip ("the App") handles personal data. Fizyo Takip is a mobile application developed to help physiotherapists manage client profiles and organize sessions via a local calendar. It is designed with privacy in mind and does not collect, share, or transmit any user data externally.</p>

  <h2>Interpretation and Definitions</h2>
  <h3>Interpretation</h3>
  <p>Words with capitalized first letters have meanings defined below. These definitions apply regardless of whether they appear in singular or plural.</p>

  <h3>Definitions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Application (App):</strong> Refers to "Fizyo Takip", the mobile software program developed for physiotherapists.</li>
    <li><strong>Device:</strong> Any device capable of running the App, such as a smartphone or tablet.</li>
    <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> Any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual entered by the user.</li>
    <li><strong>You (User):</strong> The individual using the App, who is assumed to be a physiotherapy professional.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Collecting and Using Your Personal Data</h2>
  <p>Fizyo Takip does not collect, transmit, or analyze your data. All data you enter stays on your device only and is not shared with anyone, including us (the developers).</p>

  <h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>
  <h4>Personal Data</h4>
  <p>The app allows users to manually enter client-related information for their own local use, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic identifying information (e.g., name, age, gender)</li>
    <li>Notes about physical conditions or progress (as determined by the physiotherapist)</li>
    <li>Exercise-related observations</li>
    <li>Optional images added for internal session documentation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>‚ö†Ô∏è This information is not collected by the developer. It is stored locally using SQLite (sqflite package) on your device and never transmitted elsewhere.</p>

  <h4>Usage Data</h4>
  <p>Fizyo Takip does not collect any usage data such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How often you use the app</li>
    <li>Which screens you open</li>
    <li>Device details or location</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Use of Your Personal Data</h2>
  <p>Because no data is collected, we do not use any personal data for analytics, advertising, marketing, or sharing. All information is used only by the app‚Äôs user, for organizational and scheduling purposes in a professional context.</p>

  <h2>Retention of Your Personal Data</h2>
  <p>All information is stored only on your device. You control how long the data remains. Uninstalling the app or clearing app data will delete all locally saved content.</p>

  <h2>Transfer of Your Personal Data</h2>
  <p>Fizyo Takip does not transfer any data to servers, networks, or third parties. No external transmission occurs.</p>

  <h2>Delete Your Personal Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can delete any entry manually within the app.</li>
    <li>Uninstalling the app will delete all stored information permanently.</li>
    <li>There is no cloud backup unless you implement a manual one via your device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fizyo Takip does not disclose any personal data because it does not collect or access it.</li>
    <li>All data remains on your own device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Business Transactions</h2>
  <p>No user data is stored or owned by us, so in case of business sale or app transfer, no data can be transferred.</p>

  <h2>Law Enforcement</h2>
  <p>Since no user data is accessible to us, we cannot provide any data to legal authorities under request.</p>

  <h2>Other Legal Requirements</h2>
  <p>We do not hold or process any personal data, so we are not in a position to disclose or act on data for legal purposes.</p>

  <h2>Security of Your Personal Data</h2>
  <p>While the app does not collect or store your data on external servers, you are responsible for securing your device. Recommended steps include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Using device encryption and screen lock</li>
    <li>Not sharing your device with unauthorized users</li>
    <li>Regularly backing up your device data if needed</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Fizyo Takip is intended for use only by professional physiotherapists. It is not directed at children under 18 and should not be used to enter data related to minors without proper professional consent and compliance with local regulations.</p>

  <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
  <p>The app does not include any external links or web browsing functionality, so this section is not applicable.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Fizyo Takip does not use or integrate with any third-party services such as analytics, ads, or cloud storage providers.</p>

  <h2>Cookies</h2>
  <p>Fizyo Takip is a mobile application and does not use cookies or any browser-based tracking technologies.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>If changes are made to this privacy policy, they will be reflected in the updated app version or on our GitHub repository. Because no data is collected, changes will primarily relate to app features or compliance. This policy is effective as of June 7, 2025.</p>
