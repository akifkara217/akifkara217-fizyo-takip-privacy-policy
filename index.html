  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Application Name:</strong> Fizyo Takip<br>
  <strong>Developer:</strong> Mehmet Akif Kara</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Fizyo Takip is a mobile application that allows physiotherapists to create profiles about their patients, plan these profiles by adding them to the calendar, and regularly follow up on treatment processes. This privacy policy explains what information we collect, how we use this information, and what rights you have.</p>

  <p>By using the application, you agree to the collection and use of information under this policy. The privacy and security of personal data is extremely important to us.</p>

  <h2>Collected Information and Its Use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> (patients' name, age, gender, etc.)</li>
    <li><strong>Medical Data:</strong> Medical history, health status, physical assessment, exercise information, session notes.</li>
    <li><strong>Images:</strong> Photos added to session notes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Device Access</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Used to take photos. The application stores these photos only on the device.</li>
    <li><strong>Gallery (File System):</strong> Access is provided to add images found on the device to the application.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>All information collected is stored locally on the device only. It is not transferred outside the application and is never shared with third parties.</p>

  <h2>Cookies and Third Parties</h2>
  <p>The Fizyo Takip application does not use cookies and does not transfer data to any third-party service provider.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>Data is stored in the device's local database (SQLite). No cloud service is used. Device security is the responsibility of the user. Since the data does not leave the application, it does not carry a direct risk against external attacks, but the data can be seen if physical access is provided to your device.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The application does not target individuals under the age of 13. If information belonging to a child is recorded, this data is only under the control of the physiotherapist and the application developer cannot access this data.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>The privacy policy may be updated over time according to the application features or legal requirements. Updates are published on this page and come into effect as soon as they are published.</p>
